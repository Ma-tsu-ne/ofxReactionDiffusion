## Reaction Diffusion System
> Reactionâ€“diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena: the most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.
> (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system))

## Models
Reaction-Diffusion System has a few mathematical models and ofxReactionDiffusion implements three models of them.

## How to use
Models are defined `ReactionDiffusionMode` .  
You can switch drawing model by `void setMode(ReactionDiffusionMode _mode)` .

Since each mode has its own parameters, it is necessary to use the parameters properly according to the mode being used.
